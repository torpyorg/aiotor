=====

A pure python asynchronous Tor client implementation.
aiotor can be used to communicate with clearnet hosts or hidden services through the [Tor Network](https://torproject.org/about/overview.html).

**Features**
- Asynchronous implementation
- No Stem or official Tor client required
- Support v2 hidden services ([v2 specification](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec-v2.txt))
- Support *Basic* and *Stealth* authorization protocol
- ...

**Note:** This product is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) about quality, suitability or anything else.

Console examples
-----------
There are several console utilities to test the client.

A simple HTTP/HTTPS request:
```bash
$ aiotor --aiohttp-lib --url https://ifconfig.me --header "User-Agent" "curl/7.37.0"

Usage examples 
-----------

A basic example of how to send some data to a clearnet host or a hidden service:
```python
from aiotor import TorClient

hostname = 'ifconfig.me'  # It's possible use onion hostname here as well
async with TorClient() as tor:
    # Choose random guard node and create 3-hops circuit
    async with tor.create_circuit(3) as circuit:
        # Create tor connection to host
        async with circuit.create_connection(hostname, 80) as (r, w):
            # Now we can communicate with host
            w.write(b'GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: %s\r\n\r\n' % hostname.encode())
            response = await r.read()
```

TorConnector is a convenient [TCPConnector](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#tcpconnector) for the [aiohttp library](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#connectors).
The following example shows the usage of TorConnector:
```python
from aiotor.utils import aiohttp_client_session

async with aiohttp_client_session() as client:
    async with client.request("GET", "https://httpbin.org/headers") as resp:
        assert resp.status == 200
        print(await resp.text())

```

For more examples see [test_integration.py](https://github.com/torpyorg/aiotor/blob/master/tests/integration/test_integration.py)


Installation
------------
* Just `pip3 install aiohttp`
* Or for using TorConnector with aiohttp library you need install extras:
`pip3 install aiotor[aiohttp]`
